# API Testing Report

## Summary
This report documents the testing of the Social Media Content Scheduler with AI Content backend API. Testing was conducted on May 21, 2025.

## Environment
- **Server**: NestJS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT

## Test Results

### 1. Authentication API ✅

- **User Registration (POST /auth/register)**
  - Status: **WORKING**
  - Successfully registers new users
  - Properly handles duplicate email with 409 Conflict response
  - Returns user data with 201 Created status

- **User Login (POST /auth/login)**
  - Status: **WORKING**
  - Successfully authenticates users with correct credentials
  - Returns JWT token for authenticated requests
  - Returns user data in response

### 2. Post Management API ⚠️

- **Create Post (POST /posts)**
  - Status: **ERROR (500)**
  - Returns internal server error when attempting to create a post
  - Request was properly authenticated with JWT token
  - Error is likely server-side, not client-side

- **Get Posts (GET /posts)**
  - Status: **PARTIALLY WORKING**
  - Can retrieve posts but with potential issues in data format
  - Received response contains post data with proper IDs, content, and userId fields

### 3. User Management API ⚠️

- **Get User Profile (GET /users/profile)**
  - Status: **ERROR (500)**
  - Returns internal server error
  - Request was properly authenticated with JWT token
  - May indicate issues with the user profile retrieval logic or database connection

### 4. AI Content Generation API ❌

- **Generate Content (POST /openai/generate)**
  - Status: **ERROR (404)**
  - Endpoint not found
  - Returns "Cannot POST /openai/generate" with 404 status
  - Suggests the route may not be registered properly in the NestJS application

## Technical Issues Identified

1. **Server-Side Errors**:
   - Multiple 500 internal server errors suggest issues with database connectivity, schema validation, or service logic
   - 404 error for AI generation suggests missing or improperly registered route

2. **Post Processing Issues**:
   - Errors when creating posts could be related to the post processing logic or queue system
   - There might be issues with the Post schema, particularly related to the `_id` property

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - The app appears to be running but not fully functional
   - There might be missing environment variables or incorrect database connection strings

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Service Error Handling**:
   - Improve error handling to provide more specific error messages
   - Add proper logging to identify the root causes of 500 errors

2. **Review Post Schema & Processing**:
   - Check the Post schema definition, particularly the `_id` property handling
   - Inspect any background job processing for post creation

3. **Check AI Content Generation Routing**:
   - Verify that the OpenAI controller routes are correctly registered in the module
   - Ensure the path is correct (/openai/generate)

4. **Database Connectivity**:
   - Verify MongoDB connection strings
   - Check for any authentication issues with the database

5. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set (JWT_SECRET, MONGODB_URI, etc.)
   - Verify OpenAI API keys are properly configured if using external AI services

## Next Steps

1. Review the server logs for more detailed error information
2. Focus on fixing the 500 errors in post creation and user profile endpoints
3. Verify the routes for AI content generation
4. Implement improved error handling and validation
